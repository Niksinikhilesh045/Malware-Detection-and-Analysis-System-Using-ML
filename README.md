# Malware-Detection-and-Analysis-System-Using-ML
Malicious software is meant to harm your network or computer system. Malware differs from conventional programs; it can travel over a network unnoticed, modify or harm and infect systems or network, and survive. They can completely damage a network and significantly degrade machine performance.
Traditional malware detection methods have been the cornerstone of cybersecurity efforts in the past. While these conventional approaches, such as signature-based detection, heuristic analysis, sandboxing, and the use of white and blacklists, have their merits, they also come with significant limitations – particularly in the face of increasingly sophisticated cyber threats.
And as we’ll see in this article, these are limitations that can only be overcome by leveraging the prowess of artificial intelligence (AI).
Traditional malware detection typically involves two main techniques, which have been historically used by antivirus companies: static and dynamic.

# Static malware detection
Static malware analysis, or signature-based detection, is a proactive security measure that scrutinizes software without executing it. It focuses on analyzing the structure, behavior, and content of files to identify any malicious code snippets or patterns that may be lurking within. 

Even though one of the static analysis’ key advantages is speed, this approach is less effective when dealing with polymorphic or obfuscated malware variants, which are advanced forms of malware that can change their code to evade detection.

# Dynamic malware detection
More active and adaptive than static analysis, dynamic malware detection involves the execution of suspicious programs within a controlled environment, such as a virtual machine or sandbox, to observe their behavior and identify any malicious activities in real time.

By doing so, dynamic analysis can effectively trick malware into revealing itself through its behavior, even if it employs sophisticated evasion techniques.

Unfortunately, dynamic analysis is not without its drawbacks. It can be resource-intensive and time-consuming, requiring significant computational power and expertise to execute and analyze the malware safely. Even worse, some advanced malware types are designed to detect when they are being run in a sandbox environment, which makes them alter their behavior to appear benign and evade detection.

While static and dynamic malware detection techniques are still being used today, they present a lot of shortcomings, such as:

# Difficulty coping with the evolving nature of malware: 
One of the most significant challenges is the rise of polymorphic and metamorphic malware. These sophisticated forms of malware are designed to change their code and behavior to evade signature-based detection. 
# Limitations of signature-based detection: 
Signature-based detection methods struggle to detect new, unknown malware, as they rely on databases of known malware signatures (code snippets). These databases need to be frequently updated to remain effective – a task that’s virtually impossible to keep up with as the volume and variety of malware continue to grow. 
# False positives and negatives: 
Traditional methods are prone to false positives and negatives. False positives occur when benign software is incorrectly identified as malware, while false negatives occur when actual malware goes undetected, which poses significant security risks. This can also occur with machine learning methods as well, but its adaptive nature can help reduce their occurrence.
# Scalability and performance issues:
As the volume and complexity of malware continue to increase, these orthodox methods can strain the resources of detection systems. This can compromise the efficiency and performance of the systems that the malware detection was designed to protect, leading to slower response times and potential vulnerabilities.

In the face of these challenges, the cybersecurity industry and online businesses are increasingly turning to machine learning. With its ability to learn and adapt from data, machine learning offers a promising solution to overcome the limitations of traditional malware detection methods.
